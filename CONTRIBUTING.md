## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use arrow functions when possible
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
- Use `===` and `!==` over `==` and `!=`
